I am an expert in front end technologies, processes and tools. I thoroughly enjoy designing and building new capabilities relating to online systems.

I have in-depth understanding of agile and waterfall software development life cycles as well as object-oriented design principles and patterns. My team members look to me for thought and project leadership in the context of software development.
